Mappa.js is a Javascript library that allows you to overlay a `<canvas>` on top of a tile map. It also provides a set of tools for working with static maps, interactive tile maps and geo-data among other tools useful when building geolocation-based visual representations.

Mappa was originally designed for [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), but it can be used with plain Javascript or with other libraries that use the canvas element as the render object.
