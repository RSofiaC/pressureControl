# pressureControl

A pressure Control is an analog switch driven by the Vout change detected by an air pressure Sensor attached to a air input source.

## This library includes:
- [3D MODELS](https://github.com/RSofiaC/pressureControl/tree/master/3D%20Models): The 3D models used to create a costumized input
- [Arduino](https://github.com/RSofiaC/pressureControl/tree/master/Arduino): All the sketches & schematics required to drive the pressure control through an Arduino
- [ATTINY85](https://github.com/RSofiaC/pressureControl/tree/master/ATTINY85): All the sketches & schematics required to drive the pressure control through an ATTiNY85
- [Laser cutting](https://github.com/RSofiaC/pressureControl/tree/master/Laser%20cutting): Laser cutting files required to make part holders and prototypes

Refer to Arduino or ATTINY85 repos for step by step instructions
