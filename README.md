# pressureControl

A pressure Control is an analog switch driven by the Vout change detected by an air pressure Sensor attached to a air input source.

This library includes:

#3D MODELS: The 3D models used to create a costumized input
#Arduino: All the sketches & schematics required to drive the pressure control through an Arduino
#ATTINY85: All the sketches & schematics required to drive the pressure control through an ATTiNY85
#Datasheets: Main components Datasheets
#Laser cutting: Laser cutting files required to make part holders


General Specs:
#Min circuit input voltage: 4.25V
#Max circuit input voltage: 5V
#Serial communication possible
#Analog controller
